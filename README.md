## "Creating a contract MyToken using Solidity"
_This contract is made for creating a custom token named as MyToken. The contract is written in solidity, allowing us to use minting and burning functionality while keeping track of the token balance._

### Problem Statement
_Token Creation_

### Description
_It uses a simple contract written in solidity, which is a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This is a simple and easy way to the introduction to solidity programming_


### Features
_Some of the features are as follows:_

- _Creating a Token_
- _Mapping Functionality_
- _Minting Functionality_
- _Burning Functionality_


 ### Getting Started

 _To run this program, we will use **Remix** an online solidity IDE, To get started with **Remix** visit (https://remix.ethereum.org/.)_
 
- _Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar._ 
- _Now make a folder and inside the folder create and save the file with a **.sol** extension( For eg: **MyToken.sol**)._
- _To compile the code, click on the **"Solidity Compiler"** tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to the **("0.8.06")** or the latest version of it and then click on the **"Compile MyToken.sol"** button._
- _Once you are done with the code, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the **"Deploy & Run Transactions"** tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the **"MyToken"** contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the **"Deploy"** button._
- _After successful deployment of the contract you can interact with its function from the remix IDE._
